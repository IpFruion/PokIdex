# PokIdex Web App

This is a simple Web App that can analyze your Pokemon cards costs as tracked over time. It allows you to load your own *.dex* file that is used to store the information about your deck and it's price history over time.

This web app is **NOT** optimized and has been developed only since Jan 5th 2021 by me @IpFruion who knew nothing of react or developing web applications in the first place. I started this web app to learn react / JavaScript / web app creation.. Suggestions and issue requests appreciated. **There will be bugs**

Enjoy :), IpFruion
